1) How can I start KDE ?

    a) The good: using runlevel 3 for graphical login

    Modify your /etc/inittab so it looks similar to this:

    id:3:initdefault:
    rc::sysinit:/etc/rc
    rs:S1:wait:/etc/rc.single
    rm:23:wait:/etc/rc.multi
    rd:06:wait:/etc/rc.shutdown
    su:S:wait:/sbin/sulogin -p
    c1:123:respawn:/sbin/fgetty tty1 --noclear
    c2:23:respawn:/sbin/fgetty tty2 --noclear
    c3:23:respawn:/sbin/fgetty tty3 --noclear
    c4:23:respawn:/sbin/fgetty tty4 --noclear
    ca::ctrlaltdel:/sbin/shutdown -t3 -r now
    x:3:respawn:/usr/bin/kdm -nodaemon -config /etc/X11/kdm/kdmrc

    Then kdm will run when entering runlevel 3.  As you can see in this example,
    I'm using /etc/X11/kdm to store the kdm configuration files.  I advise you
    to copy the default kdm configuration from /usr/share/config/kdm to /etc/X11/kdm
    so that it wont be overwritten by updating kdebase.
    Another option would be to add:
    ---------snip---------
    UPGRADE         ^usr/share/config/kdm/.*$                NO
    ---------snap---------
    to /etc/pkgadd.conf so that it doesn't overwrite your kdm configuration when
    upgrading.

    b) The bad: using startx

    vi ~/.xinitrc
    ---------snip---------
    exec startkde
    ---------snap---------

    c) The ugly: using /etc/rc.d/kdm

    vi /etc/X11/xdm/Xsession
    ---------snip---------

    case $1 in
        failsafe)
        exec xterm -geometry 80x24-0-0
        ;;
        kde)
        exec /usr/bin/startkde
        ;;
        esac

    ---------snap---------
    ^ add the Xsession "kde"

    Then add kdm to the services to be started in /etc/rc.conf

2) Why are there so many libraries?

    You don't need to install/compile all of them, but some nice functions
    won't run without.

3) My audio skips!

    To enable real-time audio, you can use artswrapper
    as root, "chmod u+s /usr/bin/artswrapper"

4) Konqueror doesn't resume a partially-transfered file when using
    sftp://hostname.

    Periodically, updating either openssl and openssh breaks the sftp://
    KIO-Slave.  The fix is to recompile and update openssh, and then do the
    same for kdelibs.

5) The process for the fish://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx protocol died unexpectedly

    This is a known bug, read: http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145123
    Some people avoid it by defining KDE_FORK_SLAVES=true in their environment.
    If you constantly hit this bug, and the workaround works for you, you might
    want to define KDE_FORK_SLAVES in the /usr/bin/startkde, or in a script
    located in $HOME/.kde/env/

6) Can I omit particular applications during the install?

    Yes you can, by defining the DO_NOT_COMPILE variable in the Pkgfile.
    Each Pkgfile provides a complete list of the possible apps/modules that
    can be disabled for the package, but beware, some packages won't build
    if you disable something important. Others will build, but later on
    another package won't build because it expects that app you disabled
    previously .
    In general, the provided example is what I personally use, it works for
    me but is not guarenteed to fill your needs.

7) I have a suggestion, question, or constructive criticism for you!

    Good, send it to alan at mizrahi dot com dot ve, I guarantee you an answer,
    but please be patient.
